        <p>Hola! My name is Happiness Isaac, and I am from Lagos, Nigeria. I enjoy cooking and exploring new places,
            I also enjoy listening to music.
            I value spending time in my quiet space - it's where I gather my thoughts and inspirations. I am currently
            studying Software Development at Brigham Young University-Idaho.
            I'm thrilled to be part of the Tech family.
            I am looking forward to creating my website and learning great things.

        <img src="images/lagos.jpg" alt="The Street of Lagos">
        <p>Lagos is the largest city in Nigeria and Africa and is one of the fastest-growing urban areas in the world,
            with over 21 million population. It is known for its vibrant music scene, featuring genres like Afrobeats
            and Juju, and has a rich cultural identity.
            Lagos is also home to the continent's busiest port, handles 80% of Nigeria's imports, and was the former
            capital of
            Nigeria until 1991. </p>
