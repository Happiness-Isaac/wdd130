            <p>Lagos is the largest city in Nigeria and Africa and is one of the fastest-growing urban areas in the
                world,
                with over 21 million population. It is known for its vibrant music scene, featuring genres like
                Afrobeats
                and Juju, and has a rich cultural identity.
                Lagos is also home to the continent's busiest port, handles 80% of Nigeria's imports, and was the former
                capital of
                Nigeria until 1991. </p>
