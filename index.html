        <p>Olumo Rock is a mountain in south-western Nigeria. 
        It is located in the city of Abeokuta, Ogun State, and was normally used as a natural fortress during inter-tribal warfare in the 19th century.
        Its patron spirit is venerated in the Yoruba religion as an orisha. The rock has a height of 137 meters above sea level.
        The name olumo is the combination of two words: "olu" which means god/deity, and "mo" which means moulded.</p>
